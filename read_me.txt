What is the structure of your dataset?
there are 183,412 rows of 3 types of data:
duration_sec and start/end_time are quantitative continues,
member_birth_year is quantitative descrite the rest of data are categorical nominal.

What is/are the main feature(s) of interest in your dataset?
I'm most interested in figuring out which features are predicting which age is more productive and help us to be the best?

What features in the dataset do you think will help support your investigation into your feature(s) of interest?
member_birth_year and our known the data for Feb 2019 will determine the age,
duration_sec will determine the productivity
rest of data will determine which best age for us or interval of age






average of ages is 34 with count 8265 but when we talk to average of count for all years will be 2413 user.
the shape of data is right skewd from age 18 to 141 the average of ages is 34 years old
count of age increase from 18 to 31 and then decrease.
range ages above mean from 20 to 45 years old.
range ages above median from 19 to 56 where the destribution is right skewd more than mean.
approxemately all the data compined under age 40 years old.
26 years old and range from 28 years old to 31 years old is more than others.
approxemately 25% of this data in only 5 ages which are 26 years old and range from 28 years old to 31 years old.
proportions of data 24.9%, 50.8%, 75.8%, and 90.3%
range ages of this proportions respectivly.
25% of data in this ages {26, [28 : 31]}
50% of data between 24 years old and 34 years old.
75% of data between 22 years old and 40 years old.
90% of data between 20 years old and 51 years old.
90% of data from 20 to 48 years old and 51 years old.
ages 75, 80, 81, 85, 89, 91, 92, 99, 109, 117, 141 is less than others
group of ages count people less than 100 person
 is{18, 70, 71, 73, [75:78], 80, 81, 85, 86, 88, 89, 91, 92, 99, 109, 117, 118, 119, 141}
when the age increase the count of people in this age decrease.

18, 70, 71, 73, 75, 78, 80, 81, 85, 86, 88, 89, 91, 92, 99, 109, 117, 118, 119, 141
this ages compined is 468 user only as a porportion of people who come to ride bike is 0.25%

approxemately range of counts people between 20 and 80 years old.
when we talk about duration second in this data approxemately more people between 18 and 65 years old.
average of age 18 years old is greater than others when we talk about duration sec

when we want more duration second its important to focus on age 18 years old in our marketing
because of average more productive in duration of second and now there only 34 person in this data.

count duration second is more between 19 and 48 years old from 48 to 63 years old decrease 
and then be few above 63 years old.
sum of duration better in this range of ages 26:31 years old which its porporthion of duration_sec is 31.6% 

30 and 31 ages is more productive when we talk to duration second; 
but it is not surprise because approxemately this 2 ages come to ride more than others 
especialy 31 years old with 10236 person.

from 21 to 45 years old greater than or equal to the mean of duration second.

aproxemetly all of data combined between 20 and 40 years old
half of customers between 28 and 36 years old
half of subscribers between 27 and 39 years old

customers are more productivity when we talk about duration second than subscribers.
